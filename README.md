#History
-------

- February 23th, 2006 - Super Mario War v1.10r6
As promised, a little update to add a great feature : Multitap 
support thanks to the work of Drakonite on the SDL library
(as well as others little fixes to the driver, but that should 
be however not visible).
- February 15th, 2006 - Super Mario War v1.10b5
It's still a wip version, and still need some rework, but since 
it's already playable and fun, I decided to release a first version.
The PS2 version is a based on an older version of smw (1.10), but 
should be updated in the future to be inline with the official version.
